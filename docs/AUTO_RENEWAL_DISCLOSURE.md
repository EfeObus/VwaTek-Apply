## Detailed Auto-Renewal Terms

### What Is Auto-Renewal?

Auto-renewal means your subscription continues automatically at the end of each billing period. Unless you cancel before your renewal date, we will charge your payment method to extend your subscription for another period.

### Billing Periods

| Plan Type | Renewal Frequency | Typical Charge Date |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Monthly | Every 30 days | Same day each month |
| Annual | Every 365 days | Anniversary of original purchase |

### Renewal Charges

**Your payment method will be charged automatically:**

- **Monthly subscribers**: On the same date each month (or the last day of the month if that date doesn't exist)
- **Annual subscribers**: On the anniversary of your original subscription purchase

**The charge amount will be:**

- The subscription price at the time of renewal
- Plus applicable taxes (GST/HST for Canadian residents)
- In the same currency as your original purchase

### Price Changes

If we change our subscription prices:

1. **Existing annual subscribers**: Your current subscription term is not affected. New prices apply only at your next renewal.
2. **Existing monthly subscribers**: You will be notified at least **30 days** before any price increase takes effect.
3. **You may cancel** before the new price takes effect to avoid being charged the higher amount.
